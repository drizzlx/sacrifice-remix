# Sacrifice Remix

This mod adds on kill loot and increases the rate at which high-tier mobs spawn.

## Features

 - Increases the rate at which high-tier mobs spawn
 - Monsters have a chance to drop a random white/green/red item
 - Chest spawns are enabled by default (can be disabled if you want classic RoR1 Sacrifice gameplay)
 - Simple configurations to control spawn difficulty, drop rates, and which interactable objects spawn

## Installation

- Install [BepInEx Mod Pack](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/) (if you haven't already)
- Install [R2API](https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/) (if you haven't already)
- Place the mod in the Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins folder

## Gameplay Configurations
- Run the game once after installing the mod and then close it to create a config file
- The config file will be created at Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\config
- Open the config and adjust to your liking
- If your game is running you will need to close it before changes take effect

## Special Thanks

A huge shout-out to the following creators. Some of the features are loosly based on their code.
