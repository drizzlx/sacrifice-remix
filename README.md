# Sacrifice Remix
**Contact: keepingitmods@gmail.com; or Discord: drizzlx#8615**

Adds a chance for mobs to drop loot and increases the rate at which more difficult mobs spawn.

Chests are enabled by default, but you can disable them for classic RoR1 Sacrifice gameplay.

## Features
 - Increases the rate at which more difficult mobs spawn
 - Monsters have a chance to drop a random white/green/red item
 - Chest spawns are enabled by default; they can be disabled if you want classic RoR1 Sacrifice gameplay
 - Simple configurations to control spawn difficulty, drop rates, and which interactable objects spawn

## Installation
- Install [BepInEx Mod Pack](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/) (if you haven't already)
- Install [R2API](https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/) (if you haven't already)
- Place the mod in the Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins folder

## Configurations
- Run the game once after installing the mod so the config file is created, and then close the game
- Open SacrificeRemix.cfg in Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\config
- If your game is running you will need to close it before changes take effect, or you can run the in-game console command "sr_reload".

## Special Thanks
A huge shout-out to the following creators! Some of the features are loosely based on their code.
