**Contact: keepingitmods@gmail.com; or Discord: drizzlx#8615**

Adds a chance for mobs to drop loot and increases the rate at which more difficult mobs spawn.

Chests are enabled by default, but you can disable them for classic RoR1 Sacrifice gameplay.

## Features
 - Increases the rate at which more difficult mobs spawn
 - Monsters have a chance to drop a random white/green/red item
 - Chest spawns are enabled by default; they can be disabled if you want classic RoR1 Sacrifice gameplay
 - Simple configurations to control spawn difficulty, drop rates, and which interactable objects spawn

## Installation
- Install [BepInEx Mod Pack](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/) (if you haven't already)
- Install [R2API](https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/) (if you haven't already)
- Place the mod in the Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins folder

## Gameplay Configurations
- Run the game once after installing the mod and then close it to create a config file
- The config file will be created at Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\config
- Open the config and adjust to your liking
- If your game is running you will need to close it before changes take effect

## Special Thanks
A huge shout-out to the following creators! Some of the features are loosly based on their code.
